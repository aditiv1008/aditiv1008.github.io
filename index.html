					<h2><a href="#">My name is Aditi Vishwanath</a></h2>
					<p>I am currently a senior at Cornell University and graduating in May 2024. I hope to be great impact in the
						landscape of technology while simultaneously learning new skills and languages everyday as the software
						engineering field is changing. During my high school career, I accrued almost 2 years of work experience. I
						had the privilege of being a practicum intern for Analytical Graphics Inc. where I learned about advanced
						technology, data communications, and software development with aerospace technology. Continuing to my next
						internship at Vanguard, I cultivated skills in REST Webservices, Spring Framework, and Angular. My following
						internship at Meta, where I implemented my own Android application using Parse Database, Facebook SDK, and
						REST APIs, strengthened my skills in coding. Furthering my knowledge in both cloud computing in Azure and
						Salesforce, I implemented an email alert mechanism project for my internship at M&T Bank this past summer
						which earned me the customer satisfaction award for boosting company reputation. My academic projects, such
						as my 9 year experience in robotics which developed my knowledge in numerous programming languages like C
						and C++, demonstrate my ability and eagerness to learn. My current project, Cornell Cup Robotics, where I am
						the team lead and a paid Systems Lab Manager, illustrates my collaborative and communication skills as part
						of the Business Communications Sub-team through my mentorship of both the team members and the Afghan
						Dreamers, an all-girls robotics team, in a C# heavy game application for the World Cup.</p>

					<p>In this project, I created a scene where the player (the cat) can move around on the terrain
						and perform different actions (all in the player mode): </br>
						• Plant a glowing tree at its location (by pressing "t") </br>
						• Make the terrain rise at its location (by pressing "r") </br>
						• Make the terrain fall at its location (by pressing "f") </br>
						Additional features include:</br>
						• The height of the cat also changes as it passes through terrain with various heights.</br>
						• through the control panel, the player can set the terrain to be mixed and modify it
						using slider </br>
						• user can make it rain and grow grass and set the trees on fire by changing the terrain to dessert on the
						panel</br>
						• The player can control the camera by dragging and scrolling. </br>
						I implemented the trees, rain, fire using billboard particle systems
						and the procedural terrain using midpoint displacement algorithm.</p>

					<p>PocketCloset is a fashion app with a virtual closet organized by categories for different articles of
						clothing such as shirts, pants, shoes and accessories and allows users to randomize an outfit everyday when
						they don't know what to wear</br>
						• Users can upload pictures of their clothing to these different categories using either their phone camera
						ot
						uploading from camera roll</br>
						• at the click of a button users recieve a different randomized outfit every day</br>
						• Through the implementation of recycler views in the randomized outfit tab, users can swipe each article of
						clothing to change it if they do not like it</br>
						• Users can click save outfit with a name for it which saves the outfit to the outfits tab keeping track of
						all their outfits</br>
						• Users have their own profile in which they can change their profile picture using the camera or camera
						roll</br>
						• Users can check their most worn and least worn clothing in their profile</br>
						• Users can log in or sign up with their own username and password which is information that is stored in
						Parse database</br>
						• Users can log in with Facebook which was implemented using Facebook SDK
						• Users can recieve push notifications when they have not worn an article of clothing in a while and
						clicking on it brings you to the app</br>

					<p>Catari Breakout is a web application game similar to Atari Breakout in which: </br>
						• 5 balls that were designed to be shaped like cats bounce off a platform which is controlled by left and
						right arrow keys</br>
						• the ball bounce off the platform and walls to break bricks using world transform hierarchies and polygon
						collision</br>
						• the balls collide with the bricks and the brick breaks into small pieces which was implemented using
						particle systems</br>
						• User wins game after breaking all bricks or loses if all balls fall past the platform </br>
						• The game is also customizable with a slider to change the brick colors and
						ball colors </p>

						</video></a>
					<p>I implemented two collaborative filtering book recommendation systems, one using item-based and one using
						user-based filtering.</br>

						First Approach:</br>
						• Created a graphical interface using Streamlit for users to pick a book and generate recommendations as
						shown in the video.</br>
						• Implemented a nearest neighbors heuristic based on a user-item matrix, finding the nearest neighbors of a
						book in the user-item space for generating recommendations..</br>

						Second Approach:</br>
						• Explored TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework that works with Keras as its backend,
						facilitating the development and training of a neural network-based recommendation system.</br>
						• Utilized embedding layers for users and items in neural networks to learn non-linear relationships and
						capture intricate patterns in user-item interactions.</br>
						• Employed a neural network with multiple layers to learn non-linear mappings between users and items,
						addressing the struggles of distance-based Nearest Neighbors.</br>
						• Trained neural networks using backpropagation, adjusting embeddings and biases to minimize the difference
						between predicted and actual ratings.</br>
						• Applied the sigmoid activation function to introduce non-linearity and capture the non-linear nature of
						user preferences.</br>
						• Implemented regularization techniques, including dropout layers, to prevent overfitting and address the
						issue of repeated recommendations.</br>
						• Implemented UI using Flask, HTML, CSS</br>

						tweet views</br>
						• supports functionalities such as favoriting and retweeting actions, infinite pagination, modal overlay for
						tweet composition, and the ability to open links in the web browser</br>
						Additionally, the app enhances user experience through the use of vector
						drawables, View Binding library for reduced boilerplate code, and scrolling effects like toolbar
						hiding/showing with CoordinatorLayout. Offline functionality allows users to access the last loaded tweets
						persisted in SQLite, refreshing on each app launch and displaying "live data" when available from the
